### The call stack

- At the most basic level, __a call stack is a data structure that uses the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle to temporarily store and manage function invocation.__

- A call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter to keep track of what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function.

- *The call stack is primarily used for function invocation*. Since the call stack is single, function(s) execution, is done, one at a time, from top to bottom. It means the call stack is synchronous.

- In summary, the key takeaways from the call stack are:

    1. It is single-threaded. Meaning it can only do one thing at a time.

    2. Code execution is synchronous.

    3. A function invocation creates a stack frame that occupies a temporary memory.

    4. It works as a LIFO â€” Last In, First Out data structure.

- #### Error messages

- JavaScript is not a compiled language.So our errors will happen at runtime, that means that we can only see whatever is wrong with the code after running it.

- The first thing that indicates something is wrong with our code is the one wich usually appears on the  console.

- __Most types of errors includes reference errors, syntac errors, range errors, and type errors__

- Being able to read error messages and practising debugging is one of the biggest weapons for a developer. By doing it frequently and with enough time we will notice a great decrease in the time we spend debugging those errors.
