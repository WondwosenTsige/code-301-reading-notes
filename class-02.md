### jQuery

- jQuery is Javascript file that you can include in your web pages. It lets you find elements using CSS-style selectors and then do something with the elements using jQuery methods.

- jQuery offers a simple way to achieve a variety of common JavaScript tasks quickly and consistently, across all major browsers and without any fallback code needed.

- jQuery doesn't do anything you cannot achieve with pure JavaScript. It is just a JavaScript file but estimates show it has been used on over a quarter of the sites on the web, because it makes coding simpler.

- jQuery's motto is "Write less, do more," because it allows you to achieve the same goals but in fewer lines of code than you would need to write
with plain JavaScript.

- __A matched set/jQuery selection__:- when you select one or more elements, a jquery object is returned.

- __Methods that get and set data__:- some jquery methods both retrive information from, and update the contents of, elemnets. But they do not always apply to all elements.

- __Objects store refernence to elements__:- when you create a selection with jQuery, it stores a reference to the corresponding nodes in the dom tree. it does not create copies of them.

- jQuery makes it easier to handle events because the event methods work across all browsers.

- jQuery offers methods that make it quick and simple to achieve a range of tasks that JavaScript programmers commonly need to perform.

- Pair programming touches on all four skills: developers explain out loud what the code should do, listen to others’ guidance, read code that others have written, and write code themselves.

##### 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

- Pair programming is the practice of two developers sharing a single workstation to interactively tackle a coding task together

- Pair programming touches on all four skills: developers explain out loud what the code should do, listen to others’ guidance, read code that others have written, and write code themselves.

- pair programming is very useful for

    1. great efficiency
    2. engaged collaboration
    3. learning from fellow students
    4. social skills
    5. job interview readiness
