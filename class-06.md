### Node, Express and APIs

- Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on chrome's V8 Javascript engine. We can use it to execute javascript on our computers

- The V8 engine is the open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers, including Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi

- Node,js lets us run javascript on the server

- Node.js is prefered to building applications that require some form of real-time interaction or collaboration

- API stands for application programming interface and it is a set of definitions and protocols for building and integrating application software. 

- An API isnâ€™t the same as the remote server. Rather it is the part of the server that receives requests and sends responses.
