### Refactoring

- __Functional programming__ is the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects.

- Functional programming concepts like immutability and pure function are big advantages to build side-effect-free functions, so it is easier to maintain systems.

- *Functional code tends to be more concise, more predictable, and easier to test than imperative or object oriented code* 

- __Pure function__ is the first fundamental conept of functional programming which returns the same result if given the same arguments

- __Refactoring__ consists of improving the internal structure of an existing programâ€™s source code, while preserving its external behavior.

- *The following are claimed benefits of refactoring:*

    - Refactoring improves objective attributes of code (length, duplication, coupling and cohesion, cyclomatic complexity) that correlate with ease of maintenance. 

    - Refactoring helps code understanding

    - Refactoring encourages each developer to think about and understand design decisions, in particular in the context of collective ownership / collective code ownership.
    
    - Refactoring favors the emergence of reusable design elements (such as design patterns) and code modules
