### CSS Grid


- CSS Grid Layout is the most powerful layout system available in CSS. 

- *A grid is a set of intersecting horizontal and vertical lines defining columns and rows. Elements can be placed onto the grid within these column and row lines.*

- CSS grid layout has the following features:

    - __Fixed & flexible track sizes:__ we can create a grid with fixed track sizes using pixels

    - __Item replacement:__ we can place items into a precise location on the grid using line numbers, names or by targeting an area of the grid.

    - __Creation of additional tracks to hold content:__ we can define an explicit grid with grid layout. The Grid Layout specification is flexible enough to add additional rows and columns when needed

    - __Alignment Control:__ Grid contains alignment features so we can control how the items align once placed into a grid area, and how the entire grid is aligned. 

    - __Control of ocerlapping content:__ More than one item can be placed into a grid cell or area and, they can partially overlap each other.

- We can work with Grid Layout by applying CSS rules both to a parent element, which becomes the Grid Container & to that elementâ€™s children,  which become Grid Items
